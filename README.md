# gen-jazz-rhythm
Taking a leadsheet score (melody and chord symbols), it generates a score with: 
- the same melody
- the chords (except the root note) for piano, with some syncopation
- the root note of each chords is assigned to a doublebass
- drums playing jazz rhythm:
  - basic ride cymbal and foot hihat typical jazz rhythm, with some variations
  - occasionally, all-drums syncopations synchronised with the piano
  - ocassionally, some crash cymbal or kick drum beat
